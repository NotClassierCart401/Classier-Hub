                    <p>Strategem Hero is a minigame in Helldivers 2. It is located in your Super Destroyer and is unlocked by purchasing the Super Citizen edition of the game. I have essentially remade the game in python to have a direct way of playing with or without Super Citizen and without having to open Helldivers and to add some custom things to it.<br><br>This is still in early stages of development. The base functionality of the game works and it is playable, but there are still many things that need to be added. These are some of the things that will be added soon:
                    <li>Next strategems showing next to the current one</li>
                    <li>The round and score showing when currently in a round</li>
                    <li>Other text visuals</li>
                    <li>Other scoring factors like perfect bonuses</li>
                    <li>MANY more strategems</li>
                    </p>

                    <p>Once you start the game, you will go through infinite rounds. Each round will contain 7 strategems with the current strategem's arrow-code presented to you. Your goal is to correctly type the code in. If you type a wrong key, the code will reset and you will have to try to type it right again. If you fail to complete all strategem codes before the time is up, you fail and the game resets. There are 4 arrow types that are possible to show up in strategem codes: Up, Left, Down, and Right. The controls for typing them are presented below (basically standard game movement)</p>
